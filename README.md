This is a repository aimed at representing the binary search tree and its time of working in search.
It implements a recursive solution (which fails at big amount of data), but it works fast.
For comparison: iterative implementation takes about 80 minutes to create a tree containing 250k nodes.


To use demonstration, please, create an object of a LinkedBST class from linkedbst.py file and call a demo_bst method with a valid path containing words.txt file
